## Big Picture

> **Imagine buying your dream home — only to find out it’s worth less than your neighbor’s nearly identical house across town. Why? Not the square footage, not the fixtures — but the people who live nearby.**

Across the United States, two families might buy nearly identical houses — same size, same number of rooms, even the same amenities. Yet one of those homes may be worth significantly more than the other. The difference? Not the home itself, but the neighborhood — and more often than we’d like to admit, the race of the people living there.

Our thesis is simple: In the U.S. housing market, **race remains a powerful predictor of home value**, even when you account for structure, size, and features. This is not about the house — it’s about the neighborhood’s demographics and the legacy of structural inequality.

> The analysis in this article is based on data from the **2023 American Community Survey (ACS)** and a secondary dataset of U.S. housing transactions from Kaggle. You can read more about the data and how we cleaned it [here](data.html).

## Race and Home Value

Let’s start with the big picture. When we look at who lives where — and what those homes are worth — a clear pattern emerges:

*Figure 1: Distribution of racial groups across home value tiers.  
White residents are overrepresented in higher-value neighborhoods, while Black and Hispanic groups are more concentrated in lower-value areas.*

This suggests that **the racial composition of a neighborhood** may influence home values — even when homes are similar in size or features.


Even when the homes themselves are similar, the value attached to them changes — depending on who lives nearby.

## Can House Features Explain the Gap?

You might be thinking: maybe homes in Black or Hispanic neighborhoods are just **smaller, older**, or missing key amenities.

We dug into our data to test that. What we found is that **area (square footage)** and **number of bathrooms** are the most important predictors of home price. As you might expect, larger homes and those with more bathrooms tend to cost more.

*Figure 2: Relationship between physical home features and housing value.  
Square footage and number of bathrooms are the strongest predictors of price. Bedrooms and parking features play a smaller or inconsistent role.*

But these physical features still **don’t explain the racial gap in home values** — they’re only part of the story.


The relationship is clear: as **square footage increases**, so does home value. But that only explains part of the picture.

> Our dataset doesn't directly link features like size or bathrooms to the **racial composition** of neighborhoods.  
> So while we can see that these features affect price, we **can’t explain racial disparities in home values** using features alone.

That’s where broader research comes in. National studies have shown that even when homes are **structurally identical**, those in **majority-Black neighborhoods** are often valued lower than those in predominantly **White areas**.

> The gap, in many cases, isn’t about the home — **it’s about the neighborhood.**

## Try It Yourself

We’ve built a simple interactive map that lets you explore this issue in your own state.

Below is the Shiny app that visualizes **average home values by race** for each state in the U.S.  
**Select a racial group from the sidebar to see how average home values vary across states.**

## What This Means

Our findings suggest that **racial disparities in home value are not fully explained by home size or amenities**. Instead, they reflect deeper patterns of inequality embedded in how neighborhoods are perceived and valued.

Even two identical homes — same layout, same condition — can be valued differently based on who lives next door. Until these systemic issues are addressed, market-based housing inequality will persist — not because of what a home is, but because of where and with whom it stands.
