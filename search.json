    "text": "Progress Reflection\nThis week, we made substantial progress on the interactive component of our final project. The main feature we added is a boxplot visualization of household income across racial groups. This allows users to see big-picture trends in income inequality based on race. By using scale_y_log10(), we make sure outliers don’t dominate the plot and users can still explore subtle differences in the distributions.\nImportantly, the interactive includes a personal aspect. Users can filter the full dataset by race and state elsewhere in the project, and we plan to expand this to include personalized comparisons, where users can input their own income and compare it to medians by race or state. This helps people engage with the data on a personal level, rather than just looking at abstract charts.\nNext steps include adding a state-level map of rent burden and building more guidance into the interface—tooltips, hover labels, and prompts to help users discover insights they might not expect."

    "text": "Challenges in Combining Datasets\nCombining datasets can present several challenges, particularly when dealing with housing data from different sources. In our case, integrating the original housing dataset from Kaggle with a new dataset introduced several difficulties:\n\nInconsistent Data Formats\nThe two datasets utilized different formats for representing similar information. For instance, one dataset recorded dates in ‘MM/DD/YYYY’ format, while the other used ‘YYYY-MM-DD’. Additionally, categorical variables like property types were labeled differently across datasets (‘Single Family’ vs. ‘SFH’), necessitating meticulous standardization before integration.\n\n\nDisparate Feature Sets\nEach dataset contained unique features not present in the other. The original dataset included detailed information on interior features such as the number of fireplaces and flooring types, whereas the new dataset provided data on neighborhood amenities and crime rates. This mismatch required careful consideration to align relevant features for a meaningful comparative analysis.\n\n\nGeographical Misalignment\nThe datasets covered overlapping but not identical geographical areas. The original dataset focused on urban regions, while the new dataset encompassed suburban areas. This discrepancy posed challenges in creating a unified dataset without introducing geographical biases.\n\n\nTemporal Differences\nThe datasets were collected during different time periods, with the original dataset covering 2015–2020 and the new dataset spanning 2018–2023. This temporal gap complicated trend analyses and required adjustments to account for time-based variations in the housing market."

Today, you will just be brainstorming, and then next week, you’ll get started on the main aspects of the project.\n\nStart by introducing yourselves to each other. I also recommend creating a private channel on Microsoft Teams with all your team members. This will be a place that you can communicate and share ideas, code, problems, etc.\nDiscuss what aspects of the project each of you are more or less excited about. These include\n\nCollecting, cleaning, and munging data ,\nStatistical Modeling,\nVisualization,\nWriting about analyses, and\nManaging and reviewing team work.\n\nBased on this, discuss where you feel your strengths and weaknesses might be.\nNext, start brainstorming questions you hope to answer as part of this project. This question should in some way be addressing issues around racial disparities. The questions you come up with should be at the level of the question we started with when exploring the HMDA data. (“Are there differences in the ease of securing a loan based on the race of the applicant?”) You’ll revise your questions a lot over the course of the project. Come up with a few questions that your group might be interested in exploring.\nBased on these questions, start looking around for data that might help you analyze this. If you are looking at U.S. based data, data.gov is a good source and if you are looking internationally, I recommend checking out the World Bank. Also, try Googling for data. Include “data set” or “dataset” in your query. You might even include “CSV” or some other format. Using “data” by itself in your query often doesn’t work too well. Spend some time searching for data and try to come up with at least three possible data sets. (For your first blog post, you’ll write short proposals about each of them that I’ll give feedback on.)\nCome up with a team name. Next week, I’ll provide the Github Classroom assignment that will be where you work on your final project and you’ll have to have your team name finalized by then. Your project will be hosted online at the website with a URL like sussmanbu.github.io/ma4615-fa23-final-project-TEAMNAME.\n\nNext time, you’ll get your final project website set up and write your first blog post."

The importance of distinguishing between urban and rural residential properties provides insight for analyzing ownership patterns, housing distribution, and land usage across different demographic groups. Historically, the American segregational economic policy has confined minority groups into urban areas, limiting their ability to acquire larger sets of land. By comparing the distribution between land and characteristics of homeownership, the result can help to identify the factors that are major contributors to generational wealth, therefore enhancing the understanding and influence of the racial wealth gap.\n\n\nData Source\nThis analysis is based on microdata from the IPUMS USA 2023 American Community Survey (ACS, 1-Year Sample), accessed via the IPUMS extract system. The dataset includes household-level demographic and housing characteristics, harmonized for research purposes.\n\n\nUrban vs. Rural Housing Value\nThe boxplot below illustrates housing values across racial groups, separated by urban and rural locations. It reveals that Asian households living in urban areas tend to occupy the highest-value homes, whereas American Indian and Black homeowners have more limited value ranges, especially in rural settings. This reinforces how geography and race intersect to shape home equity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch Questions\n\nHow does homeownership and racial demographics interact with housing prices?\nDoes the association between housing quality and rent price vary by racial differences in neighborhood?"

    "text": "How does homeownership and racial demographics interact with housing prices?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: Each bar represents the distribution of house value tiers within each racial group, not across the full sample. This controls for unequal population sizes across races.\n\n\nOverview\nThe stacked bar chart displays, for each racial group, the percentage distribution of owned homes across three housing value tiers: Low (≤$100K), Medium ($100K–$300K), and High (&gt;$300K). Each bar adds up to 100%, emphasizing how the composition of housing wealth differs within each racial category of homeowners. This visualization highlights disparities in access to high-value housing across racial lines.\n\n\nGeographic Disparities in Housing Value\nThe housing market varies not only by race and income but also by geography. To visualize spatial inequality, we present maps of average housing value and racial disparities across U.S. states.\n\nAverage Housing Value by State\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis choropleth map shows the average housing value by state. We observe that housing values are generally higher in coastal regions—particularly in California and parts of the Northeast. In contrast, much of the Midwest and South exhibit lower average home values, reflecting broader geographic disparities in real estate markets.\n\n\nRacial Gap in Average Housing Value\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis map shows the average difference in housing values between White and Black homeowners across U.S. states. Positive values (shaded in yellow and orange) indicate that homes owned by White individuals are more valuable on average than those owned by Black individuals. States like Texas and Florida exhibit large positive gaps, while a few Northeastern states show small negative gaps. The variation highlights persistent racial disparities in housing wealth shaped by historical, geographic, and socioeconomic factors.\nComparing the two maps reveals that high average housing values do not necessarily correlate with large racial disparities. For example, California stands out with the highest average housing value, yet its racial value gap is also among the largest. In contrast, some Midwestern states have moderate home values but relatively small racial differences.\n\n\n\nInteraction between Homeownership, Race, and Housing Prices\nHomeownership does not reflect racial equity. Asian homeowners are concentrated in high-value homes while Black and American-Indian homeowners are clustered in the lower-value segments, reflecting the racial wealth gap.\n\n\nAffordability Burden by Race\nTo further examine the relationship between home value and income, the boxplot below presents the affordability ratio—calculated as housing value divided by household income—by racial group. Notably, Asian homeowners exhibit the highest median affordability ratio (3.82), suggesting they carry the greatest relative cost burden despite owning more high-value homes. In contrast, White and American Indian households show lower median ratios, indicating relatively lower cost pressure even when housing prices vary across groups.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModeling and Inference\nTo examine how income, race, and location affect home values, we fit a multiple log-linear regression model using VALUEH (housing value) as the dependent variable. The key explanatory variables include logged income (log(FTOTINC)), race (factor(RACE)), and location type (factor(ACREHOUS), &gt;10 acres indicator).\n\nKey Predictors\nIn addition to log household income, we include two categorical variables: race and house acreage. The race variable captures demographic differences across racial groups using dummy indicators. The ACREHOUS variable indicates whether the property has more than 10 acres of land, which may reflect rural-style housing or large-lot ownership, potentially influencing home value independently of income. #### Model and Predictor Selection Rationale\nThe decision to use a multiple log-log regression model stems from both the nature of the data and the economic interpretation desired. Housing values (VALUEH) and household income (FTOTINC) are both highly skewed, which can distort linear model assumptions. Taking the logarithm of these variables helps normalize the distributions, reduce heteroskedasticity, and allows the coefficients to be interpreted as elasticities—that is, percentage changes in housing value associated with percentage changes in income.\nThe predictor variables were chosen based on theoretical relevance and empirical patterns:\n\nlog(FTOTINC): Income is a fundamental driver of housing demand. Logging this variable improves model fit and enables percentage-based interpretation.\nRACE (factor): Racial disparities in housing access and value have been widely documented. Including race as a categorical predictor allows the model to measure differences in home value across demographic groups, even after adjusting for income.\nACREHOUS (factor): The acreage indicator (whether a home sits on more than 10 acres) captures a meaningful dimension of housing context, land use, and market segmentation.\n\nThis combination of variables aims to balance parsimony with interpretability, providing insights into both economic and structural determinants of housing value while avoiding unnecessary model complexity or overfitting.\n\n\nModel Specification\nWe estimate the following log-log model:\n\\[\n\\log(\\text{VALUEH}_i) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\log(\\text{FTOTINC}_i) + \\gamma \\cdot \\text{RACE}_i + \\delta \\cdot \\text{ACREHOUS}_i + \\varepsilon_i\n\\]\nThis specification captures the elasticity of income, racial differences, and the premium (or discount) associated with owning more than 10 acres of land.\n\n\nKey Results\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nEstimate\nInterpretation\n\n\n\n\nlog(FTOTINC)\n0.438\nA 1% increase in income is associated with a 0.44% increase in housing value.\n\n\nBlack/African American\n-0.158\nHomes owned by Black households are on average ~15.8% less valuable than those of White households.\n\n\nAmerican Indian or Alaska Native\n-0.423\nHomes owned by American Indian/Alaska Native households are ~34.4% less valuable than White households.\n\n\nChinese\n0.702\nChinese households own homes that are ~101% more valuable than White households.\n\n\nJapanese\n0.732\nJapanese households own homes ~109% more valuable than White households.\n\n\nOther Asian or Pacific Islander\n0.421\nThese households own homes ~52.3% more valuable than White households.\n\n\nOther race, nec\n0.017\nSlightly higher, but economically negligible difference vs. White households.\n\n\nTwo major races\n0.059\nHomes owned by two-race households are ~6.1% more valuable than those of White households.\n\n\nThree or more major races\n0.261\nHouseholds identifying with three or more races own homes ~29.8% more valuable.\n\n\nAcreage &gt; 10 acres (vs ≤10 acres)\n-0.031\nHomes on large plots (&gt;10 acres) are about 3.1% less valuable, holding other factors constant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModel fit: R² = 0.1673 (adj. R² = 0.1672). Although income, race, and land size significantly predict housing value, the modest R² indicates that important housing features and geographic context—such as neighborhood characteristics or housing quality—are likely needed to better explain variation in home values.\nTo interpret the coefficients as percent changes: \\[\n\\% \\text{Change} = (e^{\\beta} - 1) \\times 100\n\\]\n\n\nInterpretation\nIncome remains a strong predictor of housing value, but racial differences persist even after adjusting for financial status. For instance, Black and American Indian households own significantly lower-valued homes than Whites with the same income. Conversely, several Asian subgroups show significantly higher valuations.\nThis reinforces the idea that systemic disparities in housing markets are not merely economic, but also tied to demographic and geographic inequities.\n\n\n\nModel Diagnostics\n\nResiduals vs Fitted (Hexbin)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe residual plot using hexbin visualization shows a dense cluster of observations centered near zero residuals, particularly concentrated around fitted values between 12 and 13. This pattern suggests that the model is reasonably well specified for the bulk of the data. Although no strong curvature is observed, there is some mild funneling—wider spread at lower fitted values—which may hint at mild heteroskedasticity. Nonetheless, the overall structure supports the assumptions of linearity and approximate constant variance for most observations.\n\n\n\nLimitations and Assumptions\nWhile the multiple regression model includes income, race, and land acreage, it still has several limitations:\n\nOmitted Variable Bias: Important housing characteristics (e.g., square footage, number of bedrooms, building age, neighborhood amenities, proximity to jobs/schools) are not included in the model. These omitted factors are likely correlated with both income and race, and may confound the estimated effects.\nMeasurement Error: Both VALUEH and FTOTINC may be subject to reporting error or top-coding in survey data, especially in the upper tail, which could attenuate the estimated relationships.\nSimplified Geographic Controls: While the model could incorporate state fixed effects (STATEICP) to control for regional heterogeneity, our base specification only includes a coarse land classification (ACREHOUS) indicating whether a property exceeds 10 acres. This binary indicator does not fully capture urban–suburban–rural differences or local housing market dynamics.\nLinearity and Constant Variance Assumptions: Although diagnostics suggest reasonable model fit, some residual heteroskedasticity remains. This suggests that relationships may be nonlinear or vary across subgroups.\n\n\n\nFuture Extensions\nA more complete model would include richer housing attributes (e.g., lot size, building condition, year built), as well as finer geographic controls (e.g., ZIP code, county, census tract). Including state fixed effects via factor(STATEICP) would better control for unobserved regional differences. It would also be informative to explore interaction terms, such as income × race, to test whether income translates into home value equally across demographic groups. Finally, using panel data or exploiting quasi-experimental variation could help uncover causal rather than associative relationships.\n\n\nOverall Analysis\nThis study reveals a clear racial divide in homeownership patterns across the U.S. While Asian homeowners are disproportionately represented in the high-value tier, Black and American Indian homeowners are more often found in the lower or medium tiers. These disparities persist geographically, with some states showing both high average home values and large racial gaps. Affordability burdens further highlight inequality, as groups with higher-valued homes also bear heavier income-to-value ratios.\nAlthough the model shows that income, race, and land acreage significantly affect housing values, these variables explain only part of the variation. The regression results suggest that deeper structural differences—such as housing quality, local amenities, neighborhood segregation, or zoning policy—are likely at play. Future models incorporating additional housing attributes and interaction terms (e.g., income × race, income × region) will be essential for a more comprehensive understanding of equity in housing wealth."

    "title": "Analysis",
    "section": "Dataset 2 - Analysis",
    "text": "Dataset 2 - Analysis\n\nMotivation & Research Questions\nHome prices have surged, yet buyers and policymakers still debate why some properties cost millions more than others. This study investigates three broad hypotheses: - Size‐driven pricing – Larger built‑up area should raise price, but by how much? - Amenity premiums – Features such as furnishing, bathrooms, parking, and extra stories may command additional value. - Independence of effects – Do those features each add value on their own, or are some simply proxies for one another (multicollinearity)?\nAnswering these helps buyers budget efficiently and lets developers prioritise high‑value upgrades.\n\n\nExploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\nArea and Price\nWhat we see: Price rises with area, but the cloud gets wider at larger sizes. That “fan‑shape” warns that area alone is far from sufficient; luxury fit‑outs and location are also at play.\n\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurnishing Status\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurnished homes cluster at the top of the price spectrum, semi‑furnished sit in the middle, and unfurnished trail behind. The median gap between furnished and unfurnished units is roughly two million (local currency), hinting at a strong convenience premium.\nBedrooms\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMedian price increases steadily from one to five bedrooms, but dispersion within each group is large—evidence that bedroom count alone doesn’t guarantee luxury. For example, some three‑bedroom flats fetch more than four‑bedroom houses because of high‑end finishes.\nParking\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoing from zero to one parking space lifts the median price by ≈ 15 %. A second space still adds value, but the incremental gain diminishes—suggesting diminishing marginal utility.\nCorrelation Check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorrelations among predictors stay below 0.60. That is low enough to keep variance‑inflation factors (VIF) below 2, so we can include all variables in one regression without worrying about unstable coefficients.\n\n\nStatistical Modeling\n\nWhy a log‑log model?\n\nHeteroskedasticity: Raw prices show larger spread at higher values. Logging price and area pulls variances into roughly constant range.\nInterpretability: Coefficients on logged variables read as elasticities—handy for business decisions.\n\n\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe log-log transformation reveals a near-linear trend, suggesting that a constant elasticity model is appropriate for capturing the relationship between area and price.\n\n\n\nModel Diagnostics\n\nResiduals vs Fitted Plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe residuals are roughly symmetrically distributed around zero, with no visible curvature or fan-shaped patterns. This supports the assumption of linearity and homoskedasticity. A small spread (within ±1) indicates a tight fit between predicted and observed log-prices.\n\n\nQ-Q Plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Q-Q plot of residuals shows that most residuals lie along the 45-degree reference line, indicating approximate normality. Minor deviation at the tails is expected and does not severely violate model assumptions.\nOverall, these diagnostics suggest that the multiple linear regression model is well-specified and suitable for inference.\nModel specification\n\\[\n\\log(\\text{price}) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\log(\\text{area}) + \\beta_2 \\cdot \\text{bedrooms} + \\beta_3 \\cdot \\text{bathrooms} + \\beta_4 \\cdot \\text{stories} + \\beta_5 \\cdot \\text{parking} + \\beta_6 \\cdot \\text{semi-furnished} + \\beta_7 \\cdot \\text{unfurnished} + \\varepsilon\n\\] Baseline furnishing category = “furnished”.\nRobust (Huber–White) standard errors are used to guard against possible heteroskedasticity. A Durbin–Watson statistic of 1.18 suggests mild residual autocorrelation, although the model is not time-series in nature.\nKey results (robust SEs)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nβ̂\n% impact\n95 % CI\nComment\n\n\n\n\nlog(area)\n0.39\n+0.39 % per +1 %\n0.34–0.45\nSize matters, but less than proportional.\n\n\nBedrooms\n0.04\n+4 % per room\n0.01–0.07\nSmall yet significant.\n\n\nBathrooms\n0.18\n+20 % per bath\n0.14–0.23\nLargest single‑room effect.\n\n\nStories\n0.10\n+11 % per floor\n0.08–0.13\nTwo‑storey vs. one‑storey ≈ 11 % uplift.\n\n\nParking\n0.05\n+5 % per spot\n0.03–0.08\nStill valuable after controls.\n\n\nSemi‑furnished\n–0.02\n–2 %\n–0.07–0.03\nNot distinguishable from furnished.\n\n\nUnfurnished\n–0.17\n–15 %\n–0.22– –0.11\nClear discount.\n\n\n\nModel fit: R² = 0.60 (adj. R² = 0.60). VIF all &lt; 1.7, confirming low multicollinearity.\n\n\n\nInterpretation\n\nElastic size premium: Doubling floor area (+100 %) raises price by ~ 31 % (because 1.00×0.39 = 0.39; e^0.39 ≈ 1.48). Returns to scale are therefore diminishing.\nQuality of living spaces: One extra bathroom is worth roughly five bedrooms (20 % vs. 4 %). Developers looking for affordable upgrades should prioritise bathroom count.\nFurnishing’s impact: Being unfurnished strips ~15 % off value, whereas “semi‑furnished” is statistically on par with “furnished.”\nParking spots: Each additional space fetches about 5 % more, in line with urban planners’ estimates of parking scarcity premiums.\n\n\n\nLimitations and Assumptions\n\nMissing Fine-Grained Geographic Controls: The dataset lacks latitude/longitude or neighborhood-level identifiers (e.g., ZIP codes), limiting the ability to control for local housing market effects. As a result, some estimated coefficients may inadvertently capture unobserved neighborhood quality.\nCross-Sectional Data: The dataset represents a single point in time, ignoring temporal dynamics in housing markets. Without panel data, we cannot account for market cycles or unobserved household characteristics via fixed effects or repeat-sales models.\nCoarse Variable Definitions: Variables like furnishingstatus are coarse and categorical; they do not capture within-category heterogeneity (e.g., luxury vs. basic furniture), potentially understating their influence.\nModel Assumptions: The Durbin–Watson statistic &lt; 2 indicates potential residual autocorrelation, which violates the OLS assumption of independent errors. Although robust standard errors are used, more advanced techniques (e.g., clustering by region or mixed-effects models) may yield more reliable inference.\n\n\n\nFuture Directions\nTo deepen the analysis of housing price determinants, future work could incorporate more granular location identifiers (e.g., ZIP code, district) to control for local market variation and neighborhood effects. Including additional structural attributes such as year built, renovation status, or energy efficiency could improve explanatory power and reduce omitted variable bias.\nMoreover, interaction terms (e.g., log(area) × furnishing status, or bedrooms × stories) could help detect nonlinearities and conditional effects. To address potential residual correlation across homes within the same neighborhood, multilevel models or clustering by region would enhance statistical robustness.\nFinally, if panel data becomes available, fixed-effects models could be used to control for unobserved household or location-specific traits, enabling stronger causal inference about housing value drivers over time."

    "text": "Cross-Dataset Summary\nThis project used two complementary datasets to examine determinants of housing value in the United States.\n\nThe IPUMS housing dataset highlighted sociodemographic disparities in homeownership and property value. Even after controlling for income, racial differences in housing value remained substantial. Asian subgroups (particularly Chinese and Japanese) owned significantly higher-valued homes, while Black and American Indian households lagged behind, reflecting persistent structural inequalities.\nThe Kaggle housing dataset, on the other hand, emphasized property-specific features like square footage, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and parking capacity. The correlation heatmap revealed that area and number of bathrooms are most strongly associated with price, suggesting that functional space and comfort play a key role in housing valuation.\n\nTogether, these datasets reveal two sides of the housing market:\n1. Who owns valuable homes is shaped by race, income, and geography.\n2. Why homes are valued differently is largely explained by their structural features.\nFuture work can combine both types of variables to create richer predictive models and more comprehensive policy insights."

Not the square footage, not the fixtures — but the people who live nearby.\n\nAcross the United States, two families might buy nearly identical houses — same size, same number of rooms, even the same amenities. Yet one of those homes may be worth significantly more than the other. The difference? Not the home itself, but the neighborhood — and more often than we’d like to admit, the race of the people living there.\nOur thesis is simple: In the U.S. housing market, race remains a powerful predictor of home value, even when you account for structure, size, and features. This is not about the house — it’s about the neighborhood’s demographics and the legacy of structural inequality.\n\nThe analysis in this article is based on data from the 2023 American Community Survey (ACS) and a secondary dataset of U.S. housing transactions from Kaggle.

What we found is that area (square footage) and number of bathrooms are the most important predictors of home price. As you might expect, larger homes and those with more bathrooms tend to cost more.\n\nFigure 2: Relationship between physical home features and housing value.\nSquare footage and number of bathrooms are the strongest predictors of price. Bedrooms and parking features play a smaller or inconsistent role.\nBut these physical features still don’t explain the racial gap in home values — they’re only part of the story.\nThe relationship is clear: as square footage increases, so does home value. But that only explains part of the picture.\n\nOur dataset doesn’t directly link features like size or bathrooms to the racial composition of neighborhoods.\nSo while we can see that these features affect price, we can’t explain racial disparities in home values using features alone.\n\nThat’s where broader research comes in. National studies have shown that even when homes are structurally identical, those in majority-Black neighborhoods are often valued lower than those in predominantly White areas.\n\nThe gap, in many cases, isn’t about the home — it’s about the neighborhood."

Researchers have used it to study migration, labor markets, education, and housing trends, leveraging its longitudinal depth to track societal changes over time.\nPolicymakers rely on IPUMS data to guide urban planning, zoning laws, economic policies, and social programs. For example, housing lot size trends inform infrastructure and land-use decisions. Past research has explored questions like how immigration patterns impact the economy, what drives educational disparities, and how employment trends respond to economic cycles. By offering rich demographic insights, the dataset continues to shape both academic studies and policy development."

To go deeper, we explored whether this trend was uniform across locations by analyzing median prices by zip code. We found large geographic variation, with some zip codes having dramatically higher median prices than others. This suggests that the overall skew may actually be masking meaningful disparities in affordability and land value between areas—making the trend more interesting than initially assumed. It also raised the possibility that structural factors, like historic zoning or disinvestment, could be influencing housing markets."

    "text": "Future Exploration of Structural Factors\nWe plan to explore further relationships between variables to explain the aforementioned impact of structural factors, uncovering patterns that go beyond simple price distributions. For example, we’re interested in how property size, location (urban vs. rural), and racial demographics may interact with housing prices. Understanding how these variables fit together will help us build models that reflect the intersectionality of housing access, affordability, and equity. By layering in more dimensions of the data, we can move toward a more nuanced analysis of housing inequality."

    "text": "Log Transformation of Housing Prices\nTo get a clearer picture of the typical housing market and prepare for future modeling, we log-transformed the price variable to reduce the influence of extreme values. This normalized the distribution and revealed that most homes fall within a tighter price band than the raw data suggests. This step not only deepens our understanding of the price distribution but also points to potential predictor variables—such as location or neighborhood characteristics—that we can explore more fully through modeling in future posts."

As the number of bedrooms increases (from 2 to 5), the price of the house increases as well. The price difference between houses with 3, 4, and 5 bedrooms isn’t very large, but for houses with 6 bedrooms, the price decreases, and it’s almost the same as the average price for 3-bedroom houses. This could be due to insufficient sample size, or it might suggest that houses with 6 bedrooms are not as practical compared to those with 4 or 5 bedrooms. We hypothesize that a 5-bedroom house with good furnishings is worth more than a 6-bedroom house."

We can see that area and the number of bathrooms have the greatest influence on price, which is quite interesting—bedrooms, in contrast, have a weaker impact than bathrooms. This makes sense: luxury homes often have more bathrooms on each floor, sometimes even more than the number of bedrooms, while smaller houses typically have a one-to-one ratio between bathrooms and bedrooms. The relationship between bedrooms and bathrooms is also not particularly strong. The number of stories has the next highest impact on house price after area and bathrooms. The weak correlation between area and bedrooms suggests that luxury homes may include a wide range of spaces, and bedrooms are not densely packed."
