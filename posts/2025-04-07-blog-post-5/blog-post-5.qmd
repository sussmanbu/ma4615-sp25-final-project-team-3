Income Levels
	•	Most addresses show annual incomes between $50,000 and $80,000, indicating that the sample group mainly consists of middle-class households.
	•	There is noticeable regional variation in income, with coastal areas, military addresses (FPO/DPO), and locations near large cities tending to have higher median incomes.
House Size
	•	House sizes (estimated in square meters or square feet) typically fall between 5.0 and 8.5, with most values concentrated in the 6.0 to 7.5 range.
	•	Larger homes tend to be found in the Midwest and rural areas (e.g., OK, PW, MO), possibly due to lower land costs.
House Value vs. Income
	•	In many cases, home values are roughly 20–30 times the annual income, aligning with typical U.S. housing market ratios.
	•	For example, an income of $59,927.66 with a home value of $798,869.53 represents about a 13x multiple, suggesting affordable housing or strong purchasing power.
	•	Conversely, in Taylorborough, OK, an income of $55,909.32 with a home value of $936,368.96 (about 17x) points to a higher housing cost burden.
Population Density or Occupancy Metrics
	•	Some locations like Lake Elizabeth, IN (6.17) and Janetbury, NM (8.09) show higher density, likely indicating urban or suburban environments.
	•	In contrast, areas like Jacksonhaven, AZ (4.01) and Thomashaven, HI (6.62) show lower density, likely reflecting rural or less populated regions.
Special Address Patterns
	•	Multiple addresses start with FPO/DPO/USS/USNS, indicating military, diplomatic, or government-related residences.
	•	These military-associated addresses tend to have income levels comparable to standard households, suggesting military families enjoy a middle-class lifestyle.
Outliers
	•	The lowest recorded income is $17,796.63 (Lake Martha, WY), significantly below the average—possibly representing retirees, low-income households, or geographically isolated areas.
	•	The highest home value appears in Lake Kevin, UT at $1,762,214.68, which—given its associated income—likely reflects a luxury property or secondary real estate market.
