We campared the relationships between Area (sqft) of houses and price, they have strong positive linear relations, larger house is more expensive. We can also observed that most houses is smaller than 12000 sqrt, and less than one million. From the data perspective, there are significantly more cheaper and smaller houses.

From the chart 'Price by Furnishing Status', it's clear that furnished houses are significantly more expensive, semi-furnished ones are moderate but have a lower bound similar to furnished houses, while unfurnished houses are noticeably cheaper. Perhaps semi-furnished could be a good choice.

From the chart 'Price by Number of Bedrooms', it's clear that houses with one bedroom have a huge price gap compared to others. As the number of bedrooms increases (from 2 to 5), the price of the house increases as well. The price difference between houses with 3, 4, and 5 bedrooms isn't very large, but for houses with 6 bedrooms, the price decreases, and it's almost the same as the average price for 3-bedroom houses. This could be due to insufficient sample size, or it might suggest that houses with 6 bedrooms are not as practical compared to those with 4 or 5 bedrooms. We hypothesize that a 5-bedroom house with good furnishings is worth more than a 6-bedroom house.

From the 'Price vs Parking Space' chart, it's evident that houses with 0, 1, and 2 parking spaces show a gradual increase in price, while houses with 3 parking spaces experience a decline. We hypothesize that, similar to the number of bedrooms chart, the reasons could be insufficient sample size or a lack of practicality

This graph compares the correlations between key variables, with darker colors representing stronger correlations. We can see that area and the number of bathrooms have the greatest influence on price, which is quite interestingâ€”bedrooms, in contrast, have a weaker impact than bathrooms. This makes sense: luxury homes often have more bathrooms on each floor, sometimes even more than the number of bedrooms, while smaller houses typically have a one-to-one ratio between bathrooms and bedrooms. The relationship between bedrooms and bathrooms is also not particularly strong. The number of stories has the next highest impact on house price after area and bathrooms. The weak correlation between area and bedrooms suggests that luxury homes may include a wide range of spaces, and bedrooms are not densely packed.
