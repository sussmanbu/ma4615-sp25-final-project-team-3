## Data Preparation

We began our project by loading a cleaned version of our housing dataset (`housing_cleaned.rds`) to enable efficient analysis. The original data was reviewed to ensure completeness and consistency, focusing on key variables like price and zipcode. We removed columns with substantial missing values and filtered out extreme outliers to ensure that summary statistics would be meaningful. The cleaned dataset was saved as `dataset/cleaned_dataset.rds` for consistent use throughout the project.

## Distribution of Housing Prices

To begin our exploratory data analysis, we examined the distribution of housing prices and found a heavily right-skewed pattern, indicating a concentration of homes under $1 million and a smaller number of high-end properties. This insight suggested that **median price** would be a better measure than the mean in summarizing the data.

## Ethical Considerations

Alongside technical preparation, we considered the ethical implications of our work using the Urban Institute’s *Principles for Advancing Equitable Data Practice*. One principle that stood out was the importance of **transparency**. Our dataset lacks demographic variables such as income, race, or household characteristics, which limits our ability to make conclusions about affordability or equity across different populations. Recognizing and communicating these limitations is critical to avoid misinterpretation or misuse of our findings.

## Justice and Accessibility

Another key principle was **justice**, particularly the responsibility to present results in ways that are accessible and useful to the communities most affected by housing trends. We plan to share simplified summaries and visualizations to ensure our insights are meaningful beyond academic settings.

## Limitations and Commitment to Equity

While our dataset is manageable and structured, the absence of demographic context poses a risk of overlooking structural inequities embedded in housing data. Differences in home prices across neighborhoods may reflect broader systemic issues like zoning, investment disparities, or historical segregation—factors not directly visible in the current dataset. Acknowledging this, we remain committed to ethical analysis and reporting, clearly outlining what our data can and cannot explain. Going forward, we aim to integrate additional context where possible and continue to align our methods with equity-centered practices.
